Political transitions often change not just policies, but also language. Using text analysis on Ghana’s State of the Nation Addresses from 2001 to 2024, this study shows how presidential speech reflects shifts in governance, economic conditions, and national priorities.  

For example, the 2001 address delivered after the return to civilian rule, used words like shall, goal, and promise, signaling a focus on rebuilding trust and outlining future commitments. Economic terms such as debt and budget revealed early financial concerns.  

In 2009 and 2017, transitions between political parties were marked by renewed emphasis on debt, fiscal discipline, and economic reform. These speeches also highlighted infrastructure development, food security, and institutional strengthening.  

Overall, while development and governance remain constant themes, the language of SONA speeches changes in response to political context. Text analytics offers a powerful way to move beyond opinion and systematically study how leaders communicate national priorities.
