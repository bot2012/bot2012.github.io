I am a data professional who enjoys learning and improving how data is collected, prepared, and used. I have over five years of experience working with databases, analytics, and IT systems, and I recently completed a Master’s degree in Analytics.  

I mainly work with SQL and Python to clean data, build simple ETL pipelines, and support analysis and reporting. I have experience creating dashboards in Power BI and Tableau, and I have supported data systems running on Linux and Apache Tomcat. These experiences have helped me understand how data moves from raw systems to tools people actually use.  

I am still learning and actively building my skills in cloud data platforms, data engineering, and big data tools such as Databricks. I like experimenting, reading documentation, and taking courses to understand how modern data systems work.  

I enjoy working with others, asking questions, and learning from feedback. My goal is to keep growing as a data analyst and data engineer by building clear, reliable data solutions and continuously improving how I work.

This portfolio is a reflection of my learning process. It documents the projects I have worked on, the methods I am exploring, and the lessons I continue to learn along the way. My goal is not only to demonstrate technical skills, but also to show how my thinking has evolved as I grow as a data science learner and researcher.
