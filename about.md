I am learning analytics, data science, and machine learning through applied projects, coursework, and collaboration with others. I am motivated by curiosity and a desire to understand how data can be used to answer meaningful questions, improve decisions, and support research and policy work.  

My learning journey has included hands-on projects in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning, often working with real-world datasets. Through these experiences, I have come to value not only building models, but also carefully framing problems, checking data quality, and clearly explaining results. I see data science as an iterative process, one that improves through questioning assumptions, testing ideas, and learning from feedback.  

Collaboration has been an important part of my development. I have worked in team-based academic projects, competitive datathons, and professional settings where progress depended on open communication and shared effort. These experiences have helped me appreciate different perspectives and reinforced the importance of working together to produce reliable and thoughtful analysis.  

This portfolio is a reflection of my learning process. It documents the projects I have worked on, the methods I am exploring, and the lessons I continue to learn along the way. My goal is not only to demonstrate technical skills, but also to show how my thinking has evolved as I grow as a data science learner and researcher.
